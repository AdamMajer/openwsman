To perform XML Schema validation tests you will have to download a copy of the WSMAN XML Schema from the following URL:

http://www.dmtf.org/apps/org/workgroup/wsman/download.php/21173/DSP0226.WS-Management-1.0.0b.xsd

...and place the xsd file in the "etc/wsman" directory with the filename "wsman-validation.xsd".

The above link requires you to be a member of the WSMAN workgroup of the DMTF.
